# Diabetes Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves analyzing a large dataset related to diabetes, focusing on extracting meaningful insights. The project included handling a substantial dataset, performing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying machine learning models to predict diabetes outcomes.

## Objectives

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the data by handling missing values and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigating the dataset to uncover patterns and correlations.
- **Modeling:** Trying out machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes and assessing their accuracy.
- **Visualization:** Developing visualizations to better understand the data and findings.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was the Pima Indians Diabetes Database on Kaggle.

### Key Features:

- **Pregnancies:** Number of times the patient has been pregnant.
- **Glucose:** Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
- **Blood Pressure:** Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **Skin Thickness:** Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin:** 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI:** Body Mass Index, calculated as weight in kg/(height in m)^2.
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function:** A function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- **Age:** Age of the patient.
- **Outcome:** Class variable (0 or 1), indicating whether the patient has diabetes.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset and any related files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for analysis and modeling.


## Methods Used

- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Machine Learning:** Applied models including Logistic Regression and Decision Trees using Scikit-learn.
